# GAN-Style-Transfer
I have tackled the "Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself" Kaggle competition and implemented a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model and custom training to transform real-life images into a Monet style painting.

The code can be found in <code>Custom_GAN_training.py</code>. This Jupyter Notebook implements a custom Generative adversarial model and a custom training loop to take into account how a GAN is trained.
